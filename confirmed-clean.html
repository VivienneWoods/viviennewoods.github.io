  <h1>Your Session Is Confirmed</h1>
  <p>You have taken the first step. That says more than you think.</p>
  <p>This is not a conversation. It is a correction. Prepare to be honest. Prepare to be seen. You will be expected to show up ready. Not polished. Not perfect. Just willing.</p>
  <p>Check your email for the session details. If you need to cancel or reschedule, understand that doing so without proper notice reflects more than poor planning. It reveals resistance.</p>
  <div class="note">
    This is your moment to follow through. Do not waste it.
